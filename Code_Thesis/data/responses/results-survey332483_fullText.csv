Please listen to each sample and make the following two evaluations each time:  Unacceptability, which refers to your personal assessment of the extent to which an utterance is still permissible. Please rate the level of unacceptability of the audio sample by moving the slider from left (less unacceptable) to right (more unacceptable) to the position that you find most appropriate.  Demand for Consequences, which aims to measure the degree to which an utterance is (not) tolerable with respect to your understanding of social norms, conventions, and values. In other words, how strongly the audio sample calls for social or legal repercussions to the detriment of the author or speaker due to the violation of social norms or values. Please rate the demand for consequences of the audio sample by moving the slider from left (should result in weak consequences) to right (should result in strong consequences) to the position that you find most appropriate.     You can always hover your mouse over  Unacceptability and Demand for Consequences in the following pages to display the definition again.
